Part 1:

The file "polynomial_zeros.root" does not appear in the commit tagged part1-squash because it was removed as part of the commit. It was deleted from the branch, and moreover, by adding **/*.ipynb to the .gitignore file, we prevented any .ipynb files from being staged in any future commits.

Part 2:

I decided to keep Frank's changes due to his use of fixtures. Fixtures are modular and easily parametrizable, so it is good practice to use them when writing tests.

Part 3:

Frank's comments about the LaTeX import package addressed the difficulty associated with merge conflicts. If they had stored all of their report sections in separate files and merely combined them using LaTeX import, they wouldn't have to deal with a conflicting report.md every time they merge their changes from separte branches.

Part 4:

All the tests that fail are failing because of a type error with fraction and decimal. If you look more closely, the list of values p=[...] that is being passed in to these tests is populated with fractions, but it is supposed to be populated with decimals. The Bonnet recursion (bonnet.py) has the Pn coefficients typed as Decimals in the gaussquad branch (where Frank was working), but the same file (bonnet.py) in the main branch has the Pn coefficients typed as Fractions. So moving from the v4 tagging of the gaussquad branch and merging that into the main branch causes the tests--which are setup for the decimal values--to fail.
